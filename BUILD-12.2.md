# Build 12.2 — Atlas Lives

## Added
- Persistent Ask Atlas conversation on the dashboard
- Direct text input with Enter-to-send
- Suggested financial questions
- Conversation history stored locally in the browser
- Responses grounded in imported transaction data and Build 12.1 intelligence
- Dashboard and Executive Brief remain visible below Atlas

## Current architecture
Build 12.2 uses a deterministic, on-device financial question engine. No financial data is transmitted to an external language model. A secure server-side model connection can be added in a later build.
